# Gemini Customization: Karwi-Dash Project

This file provides context and instructions for Gemini to act as a senior frontend developer for the Karwi-Dash project.

## Project Overview

This is a Next.js 15+ application using the App Router. The primary focus is on building and extending feature-rich dashboards for a franchise management system. The project is built with TypeScript, utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, and integrates Supabase for backend services.

## Key Technologies

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Backend & DB:** Supabase (Authentication, Database)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui (located in `src/components/ui`)
- **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint, Prettier

## Key Libraries

- **Data Tables:** TanStack Table (`@tanstack/react-table`) is used for all data grid implementations. See `src/components/data-table`.
- **State Management:** Zustand is the primary client-side state management solution. See `src/stores`.
- **Forms:** React Hook Form (`react-hook-form`) with Zod (`zod`) for schema validation.
- **Drag & Drop:** `@dnd-kit` for drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Charts:** `recharts` for data visualization.
- **Icons:** `lucide-react`.

## Data Flow & State Management

- **Server State:** Server-side data fetching and mutations are handled through Next.js Server Actions. See `src/server/server-actions.ts`.
- **Client State:** Global client-side state is managed with Zustand. Stores are organized by feature inside `src/stores`.
- **Database:** The database schema is defined in `src/sql/schema.sql` and types are generated via Supabase CLI, located in `src/types/supabase.ts`.

## Authentication

Authentication is handled by Supabase Auth. The logic is implemented using Next.js middleware (`src/middleware/auth-middleware.ts`) and the Supabase SSR package.

## General Conventions

- Follow the existing file structure and naming conventions.
- Use absolute imports relative to the `src` directory.
- All components should be functional components using hooks.
- For any new feature, check the existing `_components` directory pattern. Create a `_components` directory for page-specific components.
- Ensure all code is properly typed with TypeScript.

## Scripts & Commands

- **Development:** `npm run dev`
- **Linting:** `npm run lint`
- **Formatting:** `npm run format`

After any code modifications, run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` to ensure the changes adhere to the project's standards before committing.
