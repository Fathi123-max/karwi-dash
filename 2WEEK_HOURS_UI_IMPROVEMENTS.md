# 2-Week Operating Hours UI/UX Improvements

## Overview

This document summarizes the UI/UX improvements made to the 2-week operating hours feature to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Visual Design Enhancements

- **Card-based Layout**: Each day now has a distinct card with rounded corners and subtle shadows
- **Color-coded Days**: Weekends (Saturday/Sunday) are highlighted with orange accents to distinguish them from weekdays
- **Improved Icons**: Added Sun and Moon icons to clearly indicate open/close times
- **Better Spacing**: Increased padding and margins for better visual hierarchy
- **Sticky Header**: The header remains visible when scrolling through days

### 2. Responsive Design

- **Grid Layout**: Days are arranged in a responsive grid that adapts to different screen sizes:
  - Mobile: 1 column
  - Tablet: 2 columns
  - Desktop: 3-4 columns depending on screen width
- **Flexible Components**: All elements resize appropriately on different devices
- **Scrollable Container**: The content area scrolls independently to prevent layout issues

### 3. User Experience Improvements

- **Clearer Labels**: Time inputs now have descriptive labels with icons
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Closed days have a muted appearance
  - Hover states provide visual feedback
  - Success/error messages are clearly displayed
- **Sticky Save Button**: The save button stays visible at the bottom when scrolling
- **Weekend Highlighting**: Weekends are visually distinct to help users quickly identify them

### 4. Component Structure

- **Consistent Styling**: Both regular hours and 2-week hours components now share a similar visual style
- **Improved Tab Navigation**: Tabs in the branch form are more visually distinct
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear visual indicators for success/error states

## Technical Implementation
