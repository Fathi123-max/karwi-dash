# Product Stock Management Enhancement

## Summary

We've implemented a comprehensive solution to better reflect stock in product orders by:

1. **Adding database triggers** for automatic stock management
2. **Enhancing the application layer** with stock availability checks
3. **Improving UI components** to display current stock levels
4. **Updating documentation** to explain the new functionality

## Key Changes

### Database Level

- Created database triggers that automatically update product stock when order items are created, modified, or deleted
- Added a function `manage_product_stock()` that handles all stock adjustments
- Added comments to document the stock_quantity field

### Application Level

- Added `checkStockAvailability()` function to verify stock before placing orders
- Updated `placeOrder()` to use the new stock checking functionality
- Modified order fetching to include product information with order items

### User Interface

- Updated order details dialogs (both admin and franchise) to show product names instead of IDs
- Added current stock information display in order views
- Enhanced order history with expandable order items showing product details

## Files Modified

1. `src/sql/migrations/20250830_add_product_stock_management_triggers.sql` - Database triggers for automatic stock management
2. `src/stores/franchise-dashboard/product-store.ts` - Added stock checking functionality and updated order fetching
3. `src/app/(main)/franchise/products/_components/product-order-form.tsx` - Added stock availability check before placing orders
4. `src/app/(main)/franchise/products/_components/order-history.tsx` - Enhanced order history with product details and stock information
5. `src/app/(main)/admin/products/orders/_components/order-details-dialog.tsx` - Enhanced order details with product names and stock information
6. `src/sql/migrations/README.md` - Updated migration documentation
7. `src/sql/migrations/README-product-stock-management.md` - New documentation file

## Benefits

- **Automatic stock management** reduces the risk of inconsistencies
- **Real-time stock information** helps prevent overselling
- **Better visibility** into current stock levels for both admins and franchise users
- **Improved user experience** with product names instead of IDs
- **Enhanced order management** with detailed product information

## How to Deploy

1. Run the SQL migration script to add the database triggers
2. Deploy the updated application code
3. Test the new functionality to ensure stock is properly managed
